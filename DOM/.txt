The 3 musketeers of front-end web development are :
1- HTML(Structure), 2- CSS(style), 3- JS(logic)

Starter Code:
<style> tag connects HTML with CSS
<Script> tag connects HTML with JS

Window Object: the window object represents an open window in a browser.it is browser's object(not javaScript's) & is automatically created by browser.
-> it is a global object with lots of properties and methods.
-> each and every method, instruction we write in js are part of window Object (window objecet is global)

DOM ?    D : Document (object inside window object), basically it is a model/representation of our html code, and it is called as DOM (Document Object Model)
Def : the process of accessing html inside the js is known as DOM
- When a wep page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page
                                            window  --> every individual box is known as Node
                                              |
                                            Document
                                              |
                                             HTML
                                              |
                                    ---------------------  
                                   |                      |
                                  head                  body
                                    |                     |
                 ---------------------------       ------------------
                meta     meta   title   link        div           script
                                                    |
                                              ----------------
                                              img  h1  p  div

-> we can access all the html code from our js
-> all the html code will come and settle in js in the form of Object, and that object is known as document and document is available in window object
-> all the html code is present in document object, which is sub object (sub part) of the window object

console.log() : used to print on the screen
console.dir() : used to print properties and methods of special objects like document
- whenever we have to print objects we use console.dir() not console.log()

why use DOM ? : to make dynamic changes/manipulation when user pressed button or form submission etc in our web page
