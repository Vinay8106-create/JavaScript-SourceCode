What is JavaScript ? : It is a programming language used to give instrctions to the computer
Input (code) ---> computer ---> Output
code -> JavaScript : we can write JavaScript code in many platforms, but best platform is chrome browser

-> Html has direct connection with browser, that's why we have to link JS code to html to print js code on browser's console
js -> html -> browser (indirect connection)

-> js is a dynamically typed language : we dont have to mention previously like, what kind of data we are going to store in a variable
